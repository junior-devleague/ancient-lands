# Physics, physics, physics!

## Introduction
What is physics anyways? Physics studies matter and its motion and behavior through space and time! When we deal with an object that needs physics, we assign a **RigidBody** component to it.

Let's assign a **RigidBody** component to our Player!

## Assigning the RigidBody

1. Select the Player Object (sphere) in the Hierarchy view.
2. Use one of the two ways indicated below to assign a RigidBody component.
