## Introduction
Practice creating UnityScript variables.

## Create Variables!

To complete this activity, write out the following variables in UnityScript.

1. Declare a variable called **text** that will contain a ```String```.  
2. Declare a variable called **longNumber** that will contain a ```float```. Assign 3.245632 to this variable.
3. Declare a variable called **rb** that will contain a ```Rigidbody```.
4. Declare a variable called **speed** that will contain an ```int``` (Integer). Assign 9.43 to this variable.
5. Declare a variable called **name** that will contain a ```String```. Assign your name to this variable.
6. Declare a variable called **moveVertical** that will contain a ```float```. Assign Input.GetAxis("Vertical") to this variable.
7. Declare a variable called **moveHorizontal** that will contain a ```float```. Assign Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") to this variable.
8. Declare a variable called **movement** that will contain a ```Vector3```. Assign Vector3(x,y,z) to this variable.
9. Declare a variable called **favoriteMovie** and store your favorite movie. What data type is this value?
10. Declare a variable called **myFavoriteKindOfPi** and store the value of pi (3.14). What data type is this value?
