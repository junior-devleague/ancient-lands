# Constructing the Game Field

## Introduction
Create a game field using Unity's 3D Game Objects. Keep in mind that there are multiple ways to do things in Unity. Choose a way that you like best.

## Summary

1. Choose one of the ways below to create a **Plane**.

2. Give the **Plane** a name by double clicking the Plane that appears in the Hierarchy view. Press Enter.
3. Select the Object.
4. In the **Inspector**, click on the gear icon in the **Transform** section and select **Reset**. This resets our object's position to the origin, or center, of our scene.

5. On the left of your **Toolbar** are tools that you can use to move, rotate, and scale your object. Use the scale tool to make the object bigger.
