# Adding Materials

## Introduction
In the real world, we can't just point our fingers at something and tell it to have a color. Colors are found on materials. In this same way, we can apply color to objects in Unity by assigning the object with a **Material**.

## Summary
To add a material, complete the following.

1. In your **Project View**, Go to: Create -> Folder.
2. Name this folder "Materials".
3. Click on the Materials folder. Go to Create -> Material.
4. Name this Material "Background".
5. In your Inspector, click on the white rectangular box near Albedo.
6. Choose a color for this material.
7. Drag the name of the material in the **Project View** to the **Plane** in your scene.
